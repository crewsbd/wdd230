            <h3>Lego Land</h3>
            <p><img src="images/placeholder.svg" class="float-left"

                This is a great place to take your
                kids. Tell them we sent you and you get half off. No, that's not true.
                I can't back that up. Lego opened the first Legoland theme park in Billund, Denmark in 1968, followed by
                a second park in Windsor, England in 1996. The Carlsbad park was the third to open, in March 1999. At
                the time, Lego was considering an additional United States Legoland to be located somewhere on the east
                coast.[13] When the park opened, there were eight themed areas.</p>
            <h3>Carlsbad State Beach</h3>

                    alt="Photo of Carlsbad Beach" loading="lazy" width="200">
                This is the best beach in the universe. Trust us. That's an objective statement of fact. Carlsbad State
                Beach is a protected beach in
                the state park system of California, United States, located in Carlsbad. It is a San Diego County beach
                with coastal bluffs. Popular activities include swimming, surfing and bodyboarding several nearby
                breaks, scuba diving, fishing, and beachcombing. Many visitors camp on the campsites on top of the
                cliffs. Access to the beach is through the multiple staircases and also one ramp. Amenities include
                showers, bathrooms, electricity, water, Wi-Fi, and a camp store. There are 220 campsites total. The
                44-acre (18 ha) park was established in 1933.</p>
            <h3>Pacific Coast Highway</h3>
            <p><img src="images/place-holder.svg" class="float-left"
                    data-src=" images/california/pch_500.webp 500w, images/california/pch_200.webp 200w"
                    srcset="images/place-holder.svg" sizes="(min-width: 700px) 500px, 200px"
                    alt="Photo of the Pacific Coast Highway" loading="lazy" width="200">
                The
                highway is designated as an All-American Road. In addition to providing a scenic route to numerous
                attractions along the coast, the route also serves as a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles
                Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas.

                SR 1 was built piecemeal in various stages, with the first section opening in the Big Sur region in the
                1930s. However, portions of the route had several names and numbers over the years as more segments
                opened. It was not until the 1964 state highway renumbering that the entire route was officially
                designated as SR 1. Although SR 1 is a popular route for its scenic beauty, frequent landslides and
                erosion along the coast have caused several segments to be either closed for lengthy periods for
                repairs, or re-routed inland.</p>
