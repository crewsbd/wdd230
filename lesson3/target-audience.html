        <h2>
            Target Audience
        </h2>
        <p>
            Business owners and community members are the prime demographics that will benefit from the Fremont California Chamber of Commerce website. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Personas
        </h3>
        <p>
            <b>Businesses</b> - Any business owner in Fremont will want to be intimately familar with the Chamber of Commerce.  It's the primary place for navigating inter-business initiatives and potentially establishing new ones.  It's also a great place for new business owners to get a feel for the area.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Community Members</b> - Any member of the Fremont community can also find value in the information provided on the Chamber of Commerces website.  From learning about a local business to finding employment, there is a wealth of information to help while interacting with businesses.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Scenarios
        </h3>
        <p>
            <b>Opening a shop</b> - Someone sees a need for high end commercial cookware store in north Fremont.  This person first logs into the Chamber of Commerce website to see if perhaps this store indeed does not exist.  Finding that it does not, they get into contact with local resaurants through the site and gauge the level of interest in such a shop. Finding many of the local businesses frustrated by this missing niche, the prospective shop owner pulls the trigger on loans, contractors and supply contracts necessary to start the business.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Improving business climate</b> - Several local business owners have had to close up shop due to growing rent, property taxes, regulatory fees and online commerce.  The remaining businesses are also feeling the strain of operating under such conditions.  Wanting to pressure the local government to take steps to reduce these overheads, they reach out through the Chamber of Commerce website to as many sympathetic local businesses as possible and, as one, express their concerns to the local city and county governments.
